# Blockchain Demo App
## Description
A minimalist demo application, simulating records deployed as a blockchain.

## The Components
The app is made up of:

    1. A Node.js frontend service
    2. A Flask-Restful backend API service
    3. A Redis cache service between the frontend and backend services
    4. A MongoDB database backend service

Each service will be packaged into a Docker image for deployment and orchestration.
